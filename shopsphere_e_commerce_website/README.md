# GROUP 3⚙️: E-COMMERCE WEBSITE

## Project Overview
This project is an e-commerce website designed to sell a variety of goods, including books, artwork, shoes, and electronics. The website provides a user-friendly platform where customers can browse through different product categories, search for specific items, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout. It also features an admin interface for managing products efficiently.

## Problem Statement
Many e-commerce websites today focus on a specific type of product, making it difficult for users to find a variety of goods under one roof. Additionally, some of these websites are not user-friendly, leading to a frustrating shopping experience.

## Solution
Our solution is to create a well-structured and user-friendly e-commerce website that caters to users looking for a wide range of products in one place. The website allows users to easily navigate between categories, search for specific products, add items to a cart, and complete their purchases seamlessly.

## MVP Features
1. User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
2. Admin Product Management: Admins can create, read, update, and delete products displayed on the website.
3. Product Selection and Cart Management: Users can browse products, select items they want to purchase, and add them to a shopping cart.
4. Checkout Process: Users can proceed to checkout and complete their purchase.
5. Search Functionality: Users can easily search for products across different categories.
